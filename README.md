`sniffer` is a tool to quickly inspect `csv` and `flat-file` files.

Need to see how many rows are in a `csv` file?
Want to see the first few rows printed out to your terminal?

Then `sniffer` is for you!

`sniffer` is built with `Rust` and is made for the average 
Data Engineering or data person who frequently need to inspect
`csv` files quicky.
